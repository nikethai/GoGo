# Azure AD JWT Authentication Strategy - Requirements

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for optimizing the Azure AD JWT authentication strategy in the Gogo survey management system. The current implementation supports hybrid authentication (both regular JWT and Azure AD tokens), but we need to establish clear guidelines on token acquisition patterns and optimize the authentication flow.

## Problem Statement

The current Azure AD implementation leaves ambiguity around:
1. **Token Acquisition Responsibility**: Whether the client application or backend service should obtain Azure AD tokens
2. **Authentication Flow Optimization**: How to streamline the authentication process for better user experience
3. **Security Best Practices**: Ensuring secure token handling across different acquisition patterns
4. **Integration Patterns**: How different client types (web, mobile, desktop) should integrate with Azure AD

## Requirements

### R1: Token Acquisition Strategy Definition

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want clear guidelines on token acquisition patterns so that I can implement secure and efficient authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating authentication patterns THEN the system SHALL support both client-side and server-side token acquisition patterns
2. WHEN implementing client-side acquisition THEN the system SHALL provide clear security guidelines for token handling
3. WHEN implementing server-side acquisition THEN the system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
4. WHEN choosing acquisition pattern THEN the system SHALL consider client type, security requirements, and user experience

### R2: Client-Side Token Acquisition Support

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to implement client-side Azure AD authentication so that users can authenticate directly with Azure AD and use tokens with the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN client obtains Azure AD token THEN the API SHALL validate the token using Azure AD public keys
2. WHEN token validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL extract user claims and establish session context
3. WHEN token is expired THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes for client-side refresh
4. WHEN token is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### R3: Server-Side Token Acquisition Support

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to implement server-side Azure AD authentication so that the backend can obtain tokens on behalf of users using authorization codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authorization code flow THEN the system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 standard endpoints
2. WHEN exchanging authorization code THEN the system SHALL securely obtain access tokens from Azure AD
3. WHEN storing tokens server-side THEN the system SHALL implement secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
4. WHEN user session expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh transparently

### R4: Hybrid Authentication Flow Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized authentication flows so that the system can handle multiple authentication patterns efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving authentication request THEN the system SHALL automatically detect token type (regular JWT vs Azure AD)
2. WHEN processing Azure AD tokens THEN the system SHALL cache JWKS keys to optimize validation performance
3. WHEN handling multiple authentication types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent user context structure
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes for different failure scenarios

### R5: Security and Compliance Requirements

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want robust security measures so that authentication tokens are handled securely across all acquisition patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling client-side tokens THEN the system SHALL validate token signature, issuer, audience, and expiration
2. WHEN implementing server-side flows THEN the system SHALL use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security
3. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive token data at rest
4. WHEN logging authentication events THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive token data

### R6: Developer Experience and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive documentation and examples so that I can implement authentication correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing client-side authentication THEN documentation SHALL provide complete examples for major frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
2. WHEN implementing server-side authentication THEN documentation SHALL include OAuth 2.0 flow diagrams and code examples
3. WHEN troubleshooting authentication THEN documentation SHALL include common error scenarios and solutions
4. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL provide test scripts and mock token generators

## Performance Requirements

- **Token Validation**: Azure AD token validation SHALL complete within 100ms for cached JWKS keys
- **JWKS Key Retrieval**: Initial JWKS key fetch SHALL complete within 2 seconds
- **Authentication Middleware**: Authentication middleware SHALL add less than 10ms overhead per request
- **Token Refresh**: Server-side token refresh SHALL complete within 1 second

## Integration Requirements

- **Existing JWT System**: Azure AD authentication SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing regular JWT tokens
- **Database Integration**: User claims from Azure AD SHALL map to existing user model structure
- **Role Management**: Azure AD roles SHALL integrate with existing role-based access control system
- **API Consistency**: Authentication context SHALL provide consistent user information regardless of token type

## Quality Requirements

### Security
- All token validation SHALL use cryptographic signature verification
- Token storage SHALL implement encryption at rest
- Authentication logs SHALL not expose sensitive token data
- PKCE SHALL be implemented for authorization code flows

### Reliability
- Authentication system SHALL handle Azure AD service outages gracefully
- Token validation SHALL implement retry mechanisms for JWKS endpoint failures
- System SHALL maintain 99.9% authentication success rate under normal conditions

### Maintainability
- Authentication code SHALL follow existing project structure patterns
- Configuration SHALL use environment variables for all Azure AD settings
- Error handling SHALL provide actionable error messages
- Code SHALL include comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Platform Alignment

### Business Value
- Supports enterprise customers requiring Azure AD integration
- Enables single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for organizational users
- Maintains flexibility for different client application types
- Reduces authentication complexity for end users

### Technical Alignment
- Follows existing clean architecture patterns in the project
- Integrates with current middleware and routing structure
- Maintains consistency with existing error handling patterns
- Supports the API-first architecture approach

## Technology Compliance

- **Go 1.24**: Utilizes latest Go features and generic type support
- **MongoDB**: Integrates with existing user and role data structures
- **Chi Router**: Maintains compatibility with existing routing patterns
- **Environment Configuration**: Follows existing configuration management patterns

## Success Metrics

- **Developer Adoption**: 90% of developers can implement authentication within 30 minutes using documentation
- **Performance**: Authentication adds less than 10ms overhead per request
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
- **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing JWT authentication
- **Reliability**: 99.9% authentication success rate in production environment
