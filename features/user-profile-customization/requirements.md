# User Profile Customization - Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing user profile customization functionality in the Gogo survey and form management system. The feature will allow users to view, edit, and manage their personal profile information, enhancing user experience and providing better account management capabilities.

### Context

Currently, the Gogo system has basic user management with User and Account models, but lacks comprehensive profile management functionality. Users need the ability to customize and maintain their profile information including personal details, preferences, and avatar management.

### Problem Statement

Users currently cannot:
- View their complete profile information in a user-friendly format
- Update their personal details (fullname, email, phone, address, DOB)
- Upload or change their avatar/profile picture
- Manage their account preferences
- View their account activity and settings

This limitation reduces user engagement and creates a poor user experience for account management.

## Requirements

### User Story 1: View Profile Information

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to view my complete profile information so that I can see all my current account details in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access my profile page THEN I SHALL see my complete profile information including fullname, email, phone, address, date of birth, avatar, and account status
2. WHEN I view my profile THEN I SHALL see my account information including username, roles, and account creation date
3. WHEN I access my profile THEN the system SHALL display my current avatar or a default placeholder if no avatar is set
4. WHEN I view my profile THEN sensitive information like password SHALL NOT be displayed
5. WHEN I access my profile page THEN the information SHALL be formatted in a user-friendly, readable layout

### User Story 2: Edit Profile Information

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to edit my profile information so that I can keep my account details current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the edit profile button THEN I SHALL be presented with an editable form containing my current profile information
2. WHEN I modify my fullname, email, phone, address, or date of birth THEN the system SHALL validate the input format and save the changes
3. WHEN I submit profile changes THEN the system SHALL update my profile information and display a success confirmation
4. WHEN I provide invalid data (invalid email format, empty required fields) THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation error messages
5. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL revert to the original profile information without saving changes
6. WHEN I update my email THEN the system SHALL verify the email format and ensure it's not already used by another account

### User Story 3: Avatar Management

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to upload and manage my profile avatar so that I can personalize my account appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on my avatar or upload button THEN I SHALL be able to select an image file from my device
2. WHEN I upload an avatar THEN the system SHALL validate the file type (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and size (max 5MB)
3. WHEN I upload a valid avatar THEN the system SHALL process, resize if necessary, and save the image
4. WHEN I upload an avatar THEN the system SHALL update my profile to display the new avatar immediately
5. WHEN I want to remove my avatar THEN I SHALL have an option to delete it and revert to the default placeholder
6. WHEN I upload an invalid file THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### User Story 4: Profile Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want my profile changes to be secure and properly authenticated so that my account information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access profile functionality THEN the system SHALL verify I am authenticated via JWT token
2. WHEN I attempt to modify profile information THEN the system SHALL ensure I can only edit my own profile
3. WHEN I update sensitive information THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes
4. WHEN I make profile changes THEN the system SHALL update the "updatedAt" timestamp
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### User Story 5: Profile Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want clear feedback when profile operations succeed or fail so that I understand the status of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit valid profile changes THEN the system SHALL return a success message with updated profile data
2. WHEN I submit invalid data THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages for each field
3. WHEN a server error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN I attempt to use an email already taken by another user THEN the system SHALL return a clear conflict error message
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate timeout and retry guidance

## Performance Requirements

- Profile page load time: ≤ 2 seconds
- Profile update response time: ≤ 3 seconds
- Avatar upload processing time: ≤ 10 seconds for files up to 5MB
- Concurrent profile updates: Support up to 100 simultaneous users

## Integration Requirements

- **Authentication System**: Integrate with existing JWT authentication middleware
- **User Service**: Extend current UserService with profile management methods
- **Database**: Utilize existing MongoDB collections (users, accounts)
- **File Storage**: Implement avatar storage solution (local filesystem or cloud storage)
- **API Consistency**: Follow existing RESTful API patterns and response formats

## Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Unit tests for all profile service methods (≥90% coverage)
- Integration tests for profile API endpoints
- Validation tests for all input fields
- File upload tests for various file types and sizes
- Authentication and authorization tests

### Accessibility
- Profile forms must be keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatible labels and descriptions
- High contrast support for profile interface
- Alternative text for avatar images

### Security
- Input sanitization for all profile fields
- File upload security validation
- Rate limiting for profile update operations
- Audit logging for profile changes
- Protection against CSRF attacks

## Platform Alignment

### Business Goals
- **User Engagement**: Improve user retention through better profile management
- **Data Quality**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date user information
- **User Experience**: Provide intuitive and responsive profile management
- **Security**: Maintain high security standards for user data

### Technical Standards
- Follow Clean Architecture patterns established in the project
- Utilize existing generic repository pattern
- Maintain consistency with current API design
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use Go 1.24 features including generics where appropriate

## Technology Compliance

- **Backend**: Go 1.24 with Chi router framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with existing connection and repository patterns
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with existing middleware
- **File Handling**: Go standard library with appropriate validation
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following current project conventions
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing error response patterns
- **Logging**: Integration with existing logging infrastructure
