## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk Tasks:**
- Task 5 (FileService): File handling complexity and security concerns
- Task 19 (Database optimization): Performance impact on existing queries
- Task 27 (Production deployment): System stability during rollout

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive testing for file operations
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain rollback procedures for all deployments
- Monitor system performance during implementation

**Dependencies Chain:**
Infrastructure → Data Models → Services → Routers → Integration → Testing → Deployment

**Quality Checkpoints:**
- Code review after each major component (Tasks 7, 9, 12)
- Performance testing before optimization (Task 18)
- Security audit before deployment (Task 22)
- Full system testing before production (Task 25)
